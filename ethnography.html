            <h1>Report on the Ethnography of Wigtonshire and Kirkcudbrightshire.</h1>
            <p>The data for this Report were collected with great care by the late Dr. Walter Gregor, and the Committee regret that our esteemed colleague did not live to receive the congratulations which they feel are due for this valuable piece of work. The schedules have been tabulated and the indices recorded by Dr. A. C. Haddon, who desires to express his thanks <span class="pb" id="p501"><a href="https://archive.org/details/reportofbritisha98brit/page/501/mode/1up" target="_blank">501</a></span>to Mr. E. W. Brabrook for assistance rendered. The following is the record of the work done in 1896 by Dr. Gregor in his own words:—</p>
            <p>‘On April 14 I went to the parish of Kirkmaiden as the guest of James McDonall, Esq., of Logan. By his help personally, and through him, by the help of the Rev. Mr. Cavan, Free Church minister at Dromore, and the Rev. Mr. Guttridge, Episcopalian clergyman at Logan, twenty-one sets of measurements were obtained, fifteen of males and six of females. On Monday, April 20, I proceeded to the Manse of Minnigaf, where I was again cordially received by Mr. and Mrs. Reid. As on my former visit, Mr. Reid afforded me every assistance he could, and eleven sets of measurements were taken, five of males and six of females. On Friday, April 24, I went to the Manse of Mochrum, and had the help of. Mr. Allan and his daughter. In that parish were got eleven sets of measurements, seven of males and four of females. On the kind invitation of Mr. Reid, minister of Balmaghie, I went to his manse on April 28. My stay in that parish produced seven sets of measurements, six of males and one of a female. The Manse of Kells was my next destination, which I reached on May 6. There I had the help and influence of Mr. Philip. In that and the neighbouring parish of Dalry only three sets of measurements were taken as my schedules were exhausted. Fifty-three sets of measurements form the result of this second visit, thirty-six of males and seventeen of females.</p>
            <p>‘As on my former visit I tried to find out those whose ancestors have lived for the longest period in Galloway in the line both of father and mother.</p>
            <p>‘In all the districts I visited every opportunity of collecting the folkore was laid hold of, and a good deal of it, some of which will prove of interest, was gathered. It may be stated that when natives of other districts were met with, they were questioned, and what information was obtained was noted down, and the county it comes from was stated. It will take a considerable time to make ready my notes, but the work will be carried out as speedily as I can.</p>
            <p>‘The Committee are again under great obligation to all those who have exerted themselves to carry out this investigation.</p>
            <p>‘I have to state that everywhere I was received with the utmost cordiality, and the hospitality and true kindness accorded to me by my hosts and their families are beyond all thanks.</p>
            <p>‘I have the honour to send to the Committee the fifty-three schedules.’</p>
            <p>Dr. Gregor has filled up schedules for 46 Wigtonshire and 36 Kirkcudbrightshire men (total 82), and for 21 Wigtonshire and 13 Kirkcudbrightshire women (total 34), making a gross total of 116 Galloway folk. These observations have been tabulated according to counties and sexes. As there is no appreciable difference between the inhabitants of the two counties, at all events so far as the men are concerned, we may describe the Galloway type in the following terms:—</p>
            <div id="Men" class="section">
                <h2>Men.</h2>
                <p>The average height of the men is 1733 mm. (5 ft. 8¼ in.), the maximum being 1853 mm. (6 ft. 3 in.) and the minimum 1587 mm. (5 ft. 2½ in.). The average height sitting is 905 mm. (2 ft. 11¾ in.).</p>
                <p>The skin is ruddy; it is not stated whether there is a tendency to freckle. The hair usually is darkish brown and straight; the actual <span class="pb" id="p502"><a href="https://archive.org/details/reportofbritisha98brit/page/502/mode/1up" target="_blank">502</a></span>figures are red 6, fair 16, brown 32, dark brown 24, black 3. (51 out of 82 are credited with straight hair, but the proportion is probably greater.) The eyes are as follows:—blue 35, light grey 25, dark grey 8, green 1, light brown 5, dark brown 8. Only a few (15) are stated to have prominent cheek bones. The nose is straight, with a slight tendency to sinuosity. The ears are flat with distinct lobes.</p>
                <p>The average cephalic index is 77.4, varying between 70.3 and 82.6. No deduction has been made to reduce it to the cranial index of the skull. The average length-height index is 66.8, and the breadth-height index 86.9. The average upper facial index 49, and the nasal index 60.4,</p>
            </div>
            <div id="Women" class="section">
                <h2>Women.</h2>
                <p>The average height of the women is 1600 mm. (5 ft. 3 in.), the maximum being 1710 (5 ft. 7¼ in.) and the minimum 1423 mm. (4 ft. 8 in.) The Kirkcudbrightshire women are somewhat shorter (1578 mm,—5 ft. 2in.) than the Wigtonshire women (1621 mm.—5 ft. 3¾), though this is not the case with the men, but the numbers are insufficient to lay any stress on this fact. The skin is usually ruddy. The colour of the hair varies more than among the men. Thus for Wigton the figures are—red 3, fair 5, brown 4, dark brown 5, black 4; and for Kirkcudbright, red 1, fair 1, brown 8, dark brown 3, black 0. It is generally straight. The eyes are as follows:—Wigton: Blue 6, light grey 2, dark grey 3, green 0, light brown 2, dark brown 8. Kirkcudbright: Blue 3, light grey 5, dark grey 1, green 0, light brown 2, dark brown 1. Thus the Wigtonshire women are somewhat darker than those of Kirkcudbrightshire. The other facial features resemble those of the men.</p>
                <p>The average cephalic index is 78.4, varying between 71.5 and 88.5, The average length-height index is 68, and the average breadth-height index 87; that of the Wigtonshire women is 88.4, and that of the Kirkcudbrightshire is 85.7, as the breadth is precisely the same in both instances (147 mm.); the difference in the index is due to the average height of the cranium being greater in the Wigton (130 mm.) than in the Kirkcudbright (126mm.) women. The upper facialindex is 47, and the nasal index 61.2. Thus, besides being slightly more brachy-cephalic, or rather less dolicho-cephalic than the men, the Galloway women have relatively broader faces and wider nostrils.</p>

            <p>The tables upon which this abstract is based have been handed to the Anthropological Institute for publication.</p>
            <p>The district surveyed by Dr. Gregor is of especial interest, as it is included in the country of the ancient Picts, a people concerning whose affinities various theories have been made. When the Ethnographical Survey of Great Britain and Ireland was originated, it was intended that this should be one of the first problems to be attacked. A comparison with the results obtained from other areas formerly inhabited by the Picts will show whether the above-described type is mainly that of the Picts, or whether it is a composite type, which will require a finer analysis. However this may be, we have at least advanced a definite stage towards the solution of this important historical and anthropological problem. Dr. Beddoe’s ‘The Races of Britain,’ p. 249, should be consulted on this subject.</p>
