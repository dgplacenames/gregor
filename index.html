            <h1>Walter Gregor's Galloway Folklore</h1>
            <p>Walter Gregor's collection of Galloway folklore joins Mactaggart's <em>Scottish Gallovidian Encyclopedia</em> and Trotter's <em>Galloway Gossip</em> as an essential record of life and language in 19th century Galloway.</p>
            <p>His work was published as in two parts (the latter postumously) in the appendices to the reports of the sixty-sixth and sixty-seventh Meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>
            <p>Despite being available online, these texts are hard to find and cumbersome to read together. In order to facilitate easier reading I have editied the two reports together here. I have also included the Report on the Ethnography of Wigtownshire and Kirkcudbrightshire complied from Gregor's measurements. While these are perhaps of less interest, they formed an integral part of Gregor's collection and help to frame the folklore in the context in which it was gathered and studied. I have added my own notes to some of the entries. This is currently a work in progress.</p>
            <p>I have attempted to keep the formatting of the original reports. I have standardized spaces before punctuation marks and occasionally ammended the formating of some of the entries. The page numbers in the margin link to the original text, which allows for comparison where needed.</p>
