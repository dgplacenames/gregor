                    <h1>Preliminary Report on Folklore in Galloway, Scotland.</h1>
                    <h2 class="byline">By Rev. Walter Gregor, LL.D.</h2>
                    <p>On October 16, 1895, I went, on the invitation of Sir Herbert Maxwell, to the Airlour, parish of Mochrum, Wigtownshire. He afforded me, during the time I was his guest, every facility to carry out the work entrusted to me. From one of his workmen. John Thomson, aged seventy years, I obtained the Folk-tale of ‘Marget Totts’ and the tale of Aiken drum the Brownie, along with a good many items of folklore, including the mode of cutting ‘The Hare.’ On Monday the 21st, on the invitation of Mr. Wright of Alticry, I went to Alticry House, and took measurements of three men, two farmers and Mr. Wright’s gamekeeper, from the last of whom I got some rhymes and other items of folklore. In the parish of Mochrum seven sets of measurements were got, and one was obtained in the neighbouring parish of Glasserton. The best thanks of the Committee are due to Sir Herbert and Lady Maxwell, as well as to the Misses Maxwell for their helpful kindness. Mr. Wright showed great attention. On Tuesday, October 22, I went to Soulseat, the Manse of Inch, the residence of the Rev. Mr. Paton. He used every exertion to help me to carry out the wishes of the Committee. He took me to those of his parishioners whose ancestors had been for the longest period in Galloway. From this parish, Stranraer and Stoneykirk, were obtained eleven sets of measurements, nine males and two females. The difficulty met with in those parishes is the mixture of modern Irish. With the help of Mr. and Mrs. Paton those whose ancestors were Irish either on the father’s or mother’s side were avoided as much as possible in the parish of Inch, though it was not always convenient to do so. From Inch were obtained several rhymes and other items of folklore. I have to say that Mr. and Mrs. Paton were most kind, and without Mr. Paton’s help not much could have been accomplished. On October 29 I went to the Manse of Minnigaff, and was most cordially received by Mr. and Mrs. Reid. Mr. Reid spared no pains to meet my wishes, both by driving me for miles through the wild Galloway moors and by taking me to those he considered able to help me both in Minnigaff and in Newton-Stewart. <span class="pb" id="p613"><a href="https://archive.org/details/reportofbritisha96brit/page/613/mode/1up" target="_blank">613</a></span>Eleven measurements of males and ten of females were obtained, along with some folklore.</p>
                    <p>Some items of folklore have not been communicated to the Committee, as I wish to make further investigation into them. It will be seen that twenty-eight measurements of males and twelve of females—in all forty—have been obtained, along with a considerable amount of folklore. The items of folklore which follow are numbered for facility of reference, and the place where each was obtained is indicated at the commencement of the paragraph.</p>
                    <p>I have only to add that nothing could exceed the kindness and courtesy with which I was received by all, and the readiness with which all gave themselves to be measured, and that all were much interested in the survey.</p>
                    <div id="1" class="entry">
                        <p>1. <span class="place head">Mochrum</span>. ‘Marget Totts.’—Once on a time a man was very hard towards his wife, and laid tasks on her no one could accomplish. He at one time gave her such a quantity of flax to spin within a fixed time that the work was beyond human power. As she was sitting in the house bemoaning herself, and thinking of what was to be done, a woman entered. Seeing her in great distress and perplexity, she asked her what was the matter with her. She told her of the task that had been laid on her by her husband. The stranger said to her: ‘I’ll tack awa’ yir lint an spin’t t’ you, an bring’t back t’ you on such and such a day (naming the day), if ye can tell me my name.’ The guidwife agreed at once, and gave the woman the lint. But she was now in as great straits as ever, and could in no way come to her apparent friend’s name, and the day on which the lint was to be brought back was drawing near. As she was one day sitting at her wits’ end in the house a man came in. He asked her what ailed her that she was looking so cast down and sad. She told him all her tale. Now near the house there was a small hill covered with thorn bushes and whins. The man told her to go to this hill and hide herself among the bushes near an open space on it, and she would hear something to help her. She did as she was told. She had not been long in her hiding-place till a lot of fairy women came with their spinning wheels and sat down on the open space not far from her. She saw her friend amongst them. As she span she went on saying, ‘Little does the guidwife ken it my name’s Marget Totts.’ The woman withdrew without being seen by the fairies. The day fixed for bringing back the yarn came, and the woman appeared with it. ‘Here’s yir yarn, if ye can tell me what my name is.’ ‘Your name’s Marget Totts,’ said the guidwife. The spinner went up the lum in a blaze of fire, and left the yarn.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="2" class="entry">
                        <p>2. <span class="place head">Mochrum</span>.—The Brownie is believed to be, for the most part, of a kind, obliging disposition.</p>
                        <p>A Brownie that bore the name of Aikendrum went one day to the mill of Birhosh and offered his services to the guidwife on the sole condition of getting a ‘cogful o’ brose each evening atween the licht an the dark’ as his wages. He took in hand for this wages to bring all the grain into the stackyard and to thresh it, and to gather the sheep into the ‘rees.’ The guidwife was quite keen for keeping him, but the daughters objected as no wooers would come to the house so long as Aikendrum was in it. The mother ordered silence, and took the Brownie into service. The harvest was late, and he began his work at once. Within a short time all the grain was safe in the stackyard. One evening he was ordered to <span class="pb" id="p614"><a href="https://archive.org/details/reportofbritisha96brit/page/614/mode/1up" target="_blank">614</a></span>gather in all the sheep. By morning, when the family was astir, the sheep were all in the ‘rees.’ ‘It must have been a hard job for you, said the guidwife, on seeing what had been done. ‘I had mair trouble,’ said the Brownie, ‘wi a little broon ane wi’ waggin’ horns nor a’ the laive thegither.’ The little ‘broon ane wi’ waggin horns’ was a hare. A married daughter came to live at the mill. One day she gave him a pair of her husband’s breeks. He was so offended that he left at once. Before going away he took out the two millstones and threw them into the weal below the bridge over the Bladnach. He would have nothing more than his fixed wages—‘the cogful of brose.’</p>

                    <div id="3" class="entry">
                        <p>3. <span class="place head">Mochrum</span>.—The following story was told to my informant when a boy by an old woman eighty years of age. It was on the Sacrament Sunday, ‘the langest day in June.’ She was a girl at the time, and was left to look after the house in the absence of the other members of the family at church. She went outside and sat down on a stone ‘t’ read her beuk.’ While sitting and reading she saw ‘the bonniest wee man she ever saw in her life come oot amon’ the thorn busses, go to the kiln knowe, and sit doon on the loupin-on-stane, and for twa oors he played on the bagpipes “The Birks o’ Aberfoyle,” the bonniest music she ever heard in her life.’ The bonnie wee man was dressed in green, braided with yellow, and had a four-cornered hat.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="4" class="entry">
                        <p>4. <span class="place head">Mochrum</span>.—About forty-eight years ago, as some men were approaching the bridge over the Airlour Burn, a big black dog with fire flying out of his mouth was seen crossing the road into a wood on the opposite side of the road. Before any of them could come up to him, he had entered the wood and disappeared.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="5" class="entry">
                        <p>5. <span class="place head">Mochrum</span>.—It is considered to be unlucky to cart away ‘standing stones,’ <em>i.e.</em> the stones of the circles called Druidical.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="6" class="entry">
                        <p>6. <span class="place head">Mochrum</span>.—It is unlucky to cart away any of the soil from a graveyard, however long it has ceased to be used. There is a farm called Kirkland in the parish of Mochrum. On it is a spot said to have been used as a burial-ground long ago. It remained untouched till about sixty years ago. At that time the tenant set about carting away the soil. Hardly had he begun work when two of the horses fell dead.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="7" class="entry">
                        <p>7. <span class="place head">Mochrum</span>.—To forget the Sabbath-day and to begin to work as on week-days was very unlucky. The farmer of D—— once forgot that it was the Sabbath, and yoked the plough as usual. A man going to church saw him ploughing; he ran to him and told him what day it was. The farmer said he had forgotten. Within a year the farmer, his wife, and the farm had all gone to ruin.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="8" class="entry">
                        <p>8. <span class="place head">Mochrum</span>.—If one was leaving a house with a grudge and did not wish the incoming tenant to thrive, the following ceremony was gone through. After all the furniture was taken out, the house was swept clean and all the ashes were removed from the hearth, which was also swept quite clean. Stones were then placed upright on the hearth, in the same way as peats are placed to make a fire. Those that entered the house would be as bare as the house, and there would be no luck to the indwellers till that fire (of stone) would burn. My informant has seen such.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="9" class="entry">
                        <p>9. <span class="place head">Mochrum</span>.—On taking up one’s abode in a house from which others had removed, in case ‘ill had been left on the house,’ a hen, a cat, a dog, or other living creature was thrown into it.</p>

                        <p>12. <span class="place head">Mochrum</span>.—A piece of ‘will-grown’ rowan tree about ten inches long used to be kept in the byre, on the ‘wa’-head’ over the door, with which each calf was rubbed when it fell from the cow. This act kept off the witches. My informant, a farmer, had such a piece in his byre not over six months ago.</p>

The face of the future husband appeared in the mirror when the last mouthful was eaten. My informant once went through this incantation, but when she came to the last bit she turned and fled in fright lest ‘Uncle Geordie’ should make his appearance.</p>

                    <div id="18" class="entry">

A story is told of the Lord Stair (John Dalrymple), who died in 1821, that a marriage party at one time met him, and as a matter of course asked him to partake of bread and cheese with a glass of whisky. He refused, but wished the two all happiness, and in token of his good will made a present of a sovereign to the couple.</p>

                        <p>122. <span class="place head">Minnigaff</span>.—As the clock strikes twelve at night on Hogmanay a large bonfire is kindled on the Green of the village of Minnigaff. For some weeks before the boys are busy collecting brushwood and pieces of fallen trees from the neighbouring woods. The Earl of Galloway, to whom the woods belong, gives all facilities for this purpose. By the last day of the year a goodly quantity of material has been gathered. On that day everyone is busy in erecting the pile to be burned, and before the appointed hour everything is ready. There is no ceremony before or at the kindling, and there is no special person set apart to apply the fire. The pile burns through the night and commonly through part of next day. It is always erected on the same spot. About seventy years ago the bonfire was composed of different material. For months before the bones all round the district were collected and stored in a little hut built by the boys with rough stones in a corner of the village green. The bones of <span class="pb" id="p622"><a href="https://archive.org/details/reportofbritisha96brit/page/622/mode/1up" target="_blank">622</a></span>any animal that had died and been buried for a considerable time were dug up and stored. For about a fortnight previous to Hogmanay the boys went the round of the village and laid all the peat-stacks under tribute. The peats were all carefully stowed away till required. On the last day of the year the peats were first piled up, and then the pile was covered with the bones. At twelve o’clock at night the whole was set on fire, and the younger part of those present ran round the blazing pile, but no words were repeated. My informant (eighty-three years of age) has engaged in all this. He also said that he as well as others used to get empty tar-barrels, put a little tar into them, place them on their heads, have the tar in them set on fire, and, with them blazing on their heads, parade the village. About thirty years ago those in authority set themselves to put down the custom. The bonfire was erected as usual, but the word went round that the kindling of it was to be prevented, and if anyone succeeded in kindling it every endeavour would be made to ‘droon’t oot,’ and this could have been easily done, as the village pump is quite close to the site of the bonfire. Nothing daunted, the villagers assembled to wait the current of events. As the midnight hour approached, the policeman made his appearance carrying a pail. He came up to the pile, put down his pail, and began to walk round and round the green. The boys stood at a distance, peeping from every corner, and watching if an opportunity of throwing a piece of fire on the pile could be found. A few yards from where it stood is a house in which lived at that time a woman named Jess Clelland. Jess was on the side of the old custom, and she was on the watch to outdo the men of authority. The policeman took a rather wider turn than usual, and when his back was turned Jess seized a burning peat from her hearth, rushed out, and thrust it into the bonfire. When the policeman turned he saw the pile in a blaze. He ran, seized the pail, and made for the pump. The pump-handle was gone, and the policeman withdrew. Jess gained the victory. Let Mr. Lang indite an ode to her.</p>

                        <p>122<em>a</em>. At Newton-Stewart there is a fire procession which starts from ‘The Angle’ on Hogmanay exactly at twelve o’clock at night. A tar-barrel is fixed on two long poles by means of two cross-bars. The barrel is well filled with tar and paraffin. The whole is mounted on the shoulders of four (?) men, and the contents of the barrel are set on fire. The procession marches along the street past the bridge over the Cree that leads to Minnigaff village. When the end of the street is reached the processionists retrace their steps till they come to the bridge. This they cross and march through the village of Minnigaff to the green, where the bonfire is now in full blaze. Here they get their barrel replenished if need be. They then retrace their steps through the village and over the bridge to Newton-Stewart, and then along the street to ‘The Angle,’ the point from which they started. Here the poles and barrel are thrown down and the whole burned. During the procession the carriers of the blazing barrel are changed every now and again. Last year an attempt was made to put a stop to the procession, under the plea that it gave occasion to much drunkenness. Mr. J. Reid, the minister of Minnigaff, remonstrated with the authorities against such a step, and most luckily his remonstrance prevailed, and the procession took place with all order, Mr. Reid himself being witness.</p>

Here is the mode of cutting it. A small quantity is left to form the ‘hare.’ It is divided into three parts and plaited, and the ears are tied into a knot. The reapers then retire the distance of a few yards, and each throws his or her ‘heuk,’ <em>i.e.</em> hook, in turn, and tries to hit and cut down the ‘hare.’ It must be cut below the grain-knot, and the reapers continue to throw their hooks in regular succession till one is skilful enough to cut it below the knot. This one is said to be the ‘best han’,’ and receives as reward double the quantity of whisky the others receive. The ‘hare’ is carried home and given to the female servant in the kitchen, who places it over the kitchen-door inside. The Christian name of the first male that enters the kitchen is the Christian name of her future husband. If there are several female servants, each in turn, as agreed, gets her chance. The ‘hare’ is allowed to hang for a considerable length of time in the place where it is first laid.</p>

She was styled queen. He also called out the name of the boy that had given the highest sum among the boys. He became king. Whisky toddy was then prepared. The teacher then gave a glass of it to the king and queen—each. The king then poured into glasses from a jug the toddy and handed them to the other scholars, whilst the queen kept the jug filled from the bowl in which it had been made. There might be one hundred and twenty scholars at Balmaclellan school, and the quantity of whisky used was a bottle, so that the toddy was weak. It was made very sweet. (Told by one who was a scholar at this school, and who has been treated to the toddy.)</p>

Near it was a hollow, and looking down into it from the hillock, he saw a great number of adders—as many as would fill ‘the box of a cart—all squirming through each other,’ with a white one in the middle of them.

In his search he found an adder-stone—a white stone with a hole through the centre of it. He preserved it carefully by putting it into his ‘kist.’ He was never without money afterwards.</p>

                            <p>539. Refreshments till within a few years ago were given to those that attended a funeral. In the case of a farmer or any of his family the guests assembled in the barn. Men were appointed to hand round the refreshments, and they were called ‘service men.’ There are generally four or five, and at times as many as six ‘services.’ Commonly a ‘service man’ stood at the door and proffered a glass of whisky to each one on his arrival. When all were assembled, the ‘service men’ began their work. First came a ‘service’ of whisky with bread and cheese—‘funeral bread,’ <em>i.e.</em>, oaten cakes baked for the funeral. The second consisted of sherry and port wine with short-bread, or small ‘bakes,’ <em>i.e.</em>, biscuits, or ‘dollar biscuits.’ The third might be of rum or brandy, and the fourth of gin, or whisky, or beer.</p>

                                <p>578. <span class="place head">Rerrick</span>.—The reaper on the first ‘rig,’ who was always supposed to be the best workman, was called ‘The Pintsman’ (pointsman), and the one on the last ‘rig’ ‘The Heel.’ There was a binder and stooker to each four ‘shearers.’ Breakfast was between five and six o’clock in the morning, and consisted of oatmeal porridge and milk. The porridge was always made the night before in a big boiler, and poured into small wooden tubs called ‘gones.’ These ‘gones’ were then covered up with the grain sack, to keep the porridge warm. The steam got condensed, and fell down all round the inside of the ‘gones,’ making the outside of the porridge cold and unpalatable; so that, as my informant said, ‘We suppit as fast as we cud, till we got to quhaur they were warm.’ For sixteen reapers and four binders there might be three of these ‘gones.’ They were placed along a big table. A basin to hold milk was placed for each two, and not one basin for each.</p>
                                <p>Instead of milk what is called ‘crap’ was sometimes used. This ‘crap’ is boiled whey. When curd fur making cheese is separated from the whey, small lumps of curds are left in the whey. When all the curd that can be got is separated from the whey, the whey is boiled. This boiling causes all the small particles of curd to coagulate still further, and then to float. When the whey cools, they sink to the bottom.</p>
                                <p>Dinner, which consisted of broth made of swine-flesh along with potatoes, was served at noon. Work was resumed almost as soon as dinner was finished, and was carried on without stop till 8 or 8.15, if daylight permitted. Supper consisted of porridge and milk, the same as breakfast. This was the course followed about fifty years ago on the farm of Baligue, parish of Rerrick. (Told by one that did harvest work on the farm for one harvest.)</p>

A man that was fishing in the loch went into the cave, found the giant asleep and his wife away. He overturned the boiling kettle over the giant’s face, and blinded him. He jumped up in his pain and tried to catch the author of his misery. It was in vain. He could not see him. He asked his name in hopes that he might in aftertimes have an opportunity of exacting justice from him. ‘I mysel’ is my name,’ was the answer. After chasing the man to no purpose he roared: ‘A’ burnt, a’ burnt.’ The roar was heard by his wife, and she called back: ‘Quha did it? Quha did it?’ He answered: ‘I mysel’ did it.’ Her reply was: ‘I thysel’ can blaw thysel’.’ The man, dreading the wife’s return, meantime made his escape from the cave with all speed, mounted his horse and fled, as the wife was coming to the cave. When she found out what had taken place, she set out in pursuit of the man that had done the evil deed. It was a hard race, but she overtook him. She seized the horse by the tail. The man turned round in the saddle and struck out with his sword and cut off her arm, and so escaped.</p>

Nanny could no longer refuse. So the minister and Nanny laid their hands on the cow to lift her. The hands had hardly touched her, when up jumped the animal as if nothing had been the matter.

A man that had wide fame for his skill in such cases was called from Ireland. The man came. The first step he took was to go into the byres and count the <span class="pb" id="p493"><a href="https://archive.org/details/reportofbritisha98brit/page/493/mode/1up" target="_blank">493</a></span>animals, and to examine them. He then ordered all the wickets or holes in the walls of the byres to be opened, so that whatever of evil influence was in them might get out. He next ordered all the members of the household to go into the dwelling-house, shut the door, cover all the windows, fall on their knees, and pray to God that what he was going to do would have the effect he wished, and not stir or open the door till three knocks were heard on it. He went into the byre, and did something no one knew, but the bellowing of the animals was terrible to be heard. After a time the three knocks on the door were heard, and the door was opened. The man had accomplished his work. When the cows were examined, each had a piece of vervain tied into the hair of the tail. The man then made a rope of hair, and tied it threefold round the bottom of the churn, and at the same time gave orders that it should not be removed. Things now went on all right, so that it was at last deemed safe to remove the rope. This was done with the result that no butter was got as formerly. The rope was replaced and Mr. Kerr, who was a handy man, made a sort of shallow tub to put over it and preserve it. Butter was again got. Vervain stitched into a band of silk was after this worn round the waist next the skin by the folk of Kilstay Farm.</p>

Having reached the island, he laid himself down under some bushes as the day was warm. He began scratching the ground with his stick. He turned up a piece of turf, and under it he saw a pot of gold. He looked behind him, and near him stood a creature in shape of a man with eyes as ‘big as a broth plate an’ legs as thick as a corn sack.’ He held a paper in his hand. He asked the shepherd to sign it, and said to him that the gold would be his if he did so. The dog in the meantime had taken to Hight in complete terror. When the shepherd heard the terms of getting the gold, and noticed how the dog had behaved, he turned and ran. The dog in fright fled to the house, rushed below the bed, and would not leave his place of refuge for some days. Search was afterwards made for the treasure, but in vain. Another version of the tradition states that the shepherd dreamed that there was a pot of gold hidden on the island, and thus was led to search for it.</p>
